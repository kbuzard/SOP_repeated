New Equilibrium Construction

From ``to\_do\_list.tex'': \\

Take out renegotiation
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Add more basic tradeoff
			\item (??) Draw inverted U for lobby
			\item Now my short punishments don't rest on renegotiation
				\begin{itemize}
					\item So now, for main analysis, must assume that we're constraining attention to a certain class of punishments: symmetric, and ``Punish for $T$ periods then go back to cooperation''
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Go back to start if deviate should work for governments, but I think I need something else for lobbies since they would like that
						\end{itemize}
					\item Can I show that mine are optimal in this class?
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Must show players are best responding in every subgame, on and off the eqm path
	\item I'm going to try to use reversion to the static nash, but this is not necessarily subgame perfect (deviations can trigger changes in future periods)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Basic intuition: lobby wants punishment to go longer, leg wants it to go shorter
			\item Ideally, want each to choose static BR in each period of punishment: in non-cooperative state, you can pick whatever you want, but the other guy is doing whatever he wants; $\tau^{tw}$ is independent of what he does
				\begin{itemize}
					\item BUT it's not independent of lobby's effort
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
	
\vskip.3in
Equilibrium: Executives set trade agreement at $t=0$. At $t \geq 1$, lobbies choose $e$, leg chooses applied $\tau$
\begin{itemize}
	\item $\forall \ t \geq 1$, leg applies $\tau^A$ if 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $\tau \leq \tau^A$ was applied last period
			\item There have been $T$ periods of punishment: I think $\tau \geq \tau^N$ and $e \leq e^N$
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Not sure how to specify lobby in these cooperation periods: $e = 0$ if $\tau \geq \tau^A$ (in any period? how are they involved in punishment? they're not really)
	\item if $\tau > \tau^A$ within the last $T$ periods, leg applies $\tau^N(e^N)$
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Think of punishment scheme being designed either by execs or by supranational body like WTO
	\item Then want to know whether it's an eqm for leg and lobbies to follow the rules

\end{itemize}

\vskip.2in
Classes of subgames
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $\tau \leq \tau^A$ and $e=0$ last period; if there had ever been a violation, it was at least $T$ periods previous.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Should I have ``and $e < \ov{e}$'' instead?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Conditions in (1) held in period $t-2$, but there was a violation in period $t-1$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Play static Nash this period and for $T-1$ more periods before switching back to (1); more precisely, $\tau^D \geq \tau^N$ and $e^D \geq e^N$.
		\end{itemize}
	\item Static Nash punishment was initiated $i<T$ periods ago, and punishment has been followed since then
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Punish this period and $T-i-1$ more periods before switching back to (1)
		\end{itemize}
	\item In any punishment period, legislature does not follow punishment: i.e. $\tau^D < \tau^N$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Restart punishment at (2)
		\end{itemize}
	\item In any punishment period, lobby does not follow punishment: $e^D < e^N$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Legislature chooses (??) BR to $e^D$, then restart at (1)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Lobby \textit{must} pay in final period of punishment, or else IC for leg will not hold. That is why the equilibrium is being re-worked.
					\item But, if leg is going to BR to lobby's payment and then restart cooperation, lobby should want to continue with punishment. This seems like a realistic set-up (your protection ends if you don't hold up your end of the deal with the promised payments).
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\vskip.5in
Conditions for equilibrium
\begin{itemize}
	\item Checking that punishment is incentive compatible
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Legislature:
				\[
				  W(\ga(e^N),\tau^N) + \frac{\de - \de^{T+1}}{1-\de}W(\ga(e^N),\tau^N) + \de^{T+1} W(\ga(0),\tau^a) \geq W(\ga(e^N),\cdot) + \frac{\de - \de^{T+2}}{1-\de}W(\ga(e^N),\tau^N)
				\]
				by definition, anything provides lower one-shot payoffs than $\tau^N$, and Nash payoffs are lower than trade agreement payoffs (need to prove this--or is it just by assumption?)
			\item Lobby:
				\[
				  \pi(\tau^N) - e^N + \frac{\de - \de^{T+1}}{1-\de} \left[\pi(\tau^N) - e^N \right] + \de^{T+1} \pi(\tau^a) \geq \pi(\tau^D) -e^D + \frac{\de - \de^{T+2}}{1-\de} \left[\pi(\tau^a)\right]
				\]
				best deviation, given that leg will one-shot best respond is also $e^N$; given $\pi(\tau^N) - e^N \geq \tau^a$, which is necessary for any of this to be interesting, this condition holds. \\
				Since the best deviation is to the Nash tariff, it reduces to
				\[
				  \frac{\de - \de^{T+1}}{1-\de} \left[\pi(\tau^N) - e^N \right] \geq \frac{\de - \de^{T+1}}{1-\de} \left[\pi(\tau^a)\right]
				\]
				\[
				  \frac{\de - \de^{T+1}}{1-\de} \left[\pi(\tau^N) - e^N - \pi(\tau^a)\right] \geq 0
				\]
				(This now seems less of a conflict with the constraint in the main problem of
				\[
				  e^b \geq \pi(\tau^b) - \pi(\tau^a) + \frac{\de - \de^{T+1}}{1-\de} \left[\pi(\tau^N) - e^N - \pi(\tau^a)\right]
				\]
				there's still a push and pull, but it's easier to satisfy---in particular, we already assume that $\pi(\tau^N) - e^N - \pi(\tau^a) > 0$ or the problem is not interesting.)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
	
	\vskip.5in
	From old construction, need to be rechecked:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item I've shown condition for lobby is constant through time except in last period, where they'll never pay
				\begin{itemize}
					\item In general, need to check how conditions change through time in punishment
				\end{itemize}
			\item Need to pay special attention to leg's condition in the last period
		\end{itemize}
