Modified Legislative Constraint
\end{center}

\vskip.2in
Here I change the legislative constraint so that future political economy weights are evaluated according to anticipated lobbying effort, instead of the current period, or ``break'' lobbying effort as in the draft submitted to the JIE
\begin{itemize}
	\item This is an attempt to keep the legislative constraint from collapsing when acknowledging the endogenous impact of lobbying effort on the break tariff, which I had not fully incorporated in the previous drafts
\end{itemize}

\vskip.3in
We can write the executives' joint problem as
\begin{equation}
  \max_{\bta} \frac{\bm{W_\text{E}}(\bta)}{1-\de_\text{E}} \hskip.2in \text{subject to}
  \label{prob:max}
\end{equation}
\begin{multline}
  \frac{\de_\text{ML} - \de_\text{ML}^{T+1}}{1-\de_\text{ML}} \left[W_\text{ML}(\ga(0),\bta) - W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_{tw}),\btw) \right] \geq
	W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_b),\tau^b(e_b),\tau^{*a}) - W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_b),\bta)
  \label{ine:leg2}
\end{multline}
\begin{center}
and
\end{center}
\begin{equation}
  e_b \geq \pi(\tau^b(e_b)) - \pi(\tau^a) + \frac{\de_\text{L} - \de_\text{L}^{T+1}}{1-\de_\text{L}} \left[\pi(\tau^{tw}) -e_{tw} - \pi(\tau^a) \right]
  \label{ine:lob2}
\end{equation}

\vskip.3in
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lobby's condition can't hold unless $\ov{e} \geq e_{tw}$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Intuition: lobby's net profit is maximized at $e_{tw}$: if you're using an effort level below this to reduce the net profit and make the lobbying constraint hold, the lobby will just increase effort up to $e_{tw}$. So have to force lobbying effort above lobby's optimal level
			\item Only holds at $\ov{e} = e_{tw}$ if net profit is exactly $\pi(\tau^a)$, in which case lobby is indifferent between trade war and trade agreement.
		\end{itemize}
	\item So, the question is: when does there exist a $\tau^a$ such that $\ov{e} \geq e_{tw}$ and the pair $\left(\tau^a,\ov{e}\right)$  satisfies the lobby's constraint?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Intuitively, how do you need to set $\tau^a$ so that $\ov{e}$, which is derived from Expression~\ref{ine:leg2} at equality, implies that $\tau^b$ is enough larger than $\tau^{tw}$ so that Expression~\ref{ine:lob2} holds?
			\item Or, am I even thinking about $\ov{e}$ anymore?
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Yes, but it has to be driven by setting $\tau^a$ high enough (otherwise, lobby would choose lower effort level, and Expression \ref{ine:lob2} would fail
				\end{itemize}
	
		\item Take $\tau^b = \tau^{tw}$ (note that lobby's constraint is still probably a problem, but this is a benchmark). Then it must be that $e_b = e_{tw}$. 
  		\begin{multline}
				\frac{\de_\text{ML} - \de_\text{ML}^{T+1}}{1-\de_\text{ML}} \left[W_\text{ML}(\ga(0),\bta) - W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_{tw}),\btw) \right] \geq	W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_{tw}),\tau^{tw},\tau^{*a}) - W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_{tw}),\bta)
			\end{multline}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Can we say anything about what $\tau^a$ must be?
					\item Not sure if there is some $\tau^a$ that makes this equal. The left hand side is positive and largest when $\tau^a = 0$ and becomes negative and smallest when $\tau^a = \tau^{tw}$. The right hand side varies from positive to zero. I haven't tried very hard, but don't see a way to sign the total expression at $\tau^a =0$
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
		
\vskip.3in
Lobby's condition will hold if $\pi(\tau^{tw}) -e_{tw} = \pi(\tau^a)$
\begin{itemize}
	\item But we'd like to be able to reduce $\tau^a$ below this level so that lobby actually cares to create a trade war
	\item This is possible only if $\ov{e} \geq e_{tw}$. So $\tau^b$ is at minimum $\tau^{tw}$
	\item Looking back at Expression~\ref{ine:leg2}, if $\tau^a$ is above optimal tariff at $e=0$, raising $\tau^a$ reduces the LHS
		\begin{itemize}
			\item At the same time, raising $\tau^a$ reduces the RHS
		\end{itemize}
	\item Lemma 1 is going to need some modifications: $\frac{\partial \ov{e}}{\partial \tau^a} > 0$ IF increase in $\ga(e_{b})$ term outweighs potential decrease in $\ga(0)$ term
\end{itemize}
	
\vskip.3in
To be clear about how legislature's decision is made:
\begin{itemize}
	\item In break stage, if $e^b$ is such that Expression~\ref{ine:leg2} 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item holds, choose $\tau^a$ (that is, there are lots of $e^b$ that make the leg unilaterally prefer a tariff higher than $\tau^a$, but dynamic incentives lead the leg to stick with the trade agreement)
			\item does not hold, choose $\tau^b$ (if breaking the agreement, want to choose static unilateral optimal tariff)
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\vskip.3in
For legislature, there is some $\tau^a$ (call it $\tau^A$) such that $W_\text{ML}(\ga(0),\tau^A,\tau^{*A}) = W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_{tw}),\btw)$
\begin{itemize}
	\item Trade war will only look like a punishment if $\tau^a < \tau^A$.
	\item So must have $\tau^a \leq \tau^A$ or else legislature will cheat. Take $\tau^A$ as rightmost boundary?
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Can I prove something about the comparison of $W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_b),\tau^b(e_b),\tau^{*A})$ and $W_{\text{ML}}(\ga(e_b),\tau^A,\tau^{*A})$?
		\end{itemize}
	\item Must have $\ov{e}$ rise above $e_{tw}$ before $\tau^a$ exceeds $\tau^A$
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Remember: $\frac{\partial \ov{e}}{\partial \tau^a} > 0$ IF increase in $\ga(e_{b})$ term outweighs decrease in $\ga(0)$ term (loss from $\ga(0)$ term is zero at optimal unilateral tariff by envelope theorem)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item I don't know where $\frac{\partial \ov{e}}{\partial \tau^a} = 0$ (that is, where $\ov{e}$ starts to decrease in $\tau^a$)
					\item If the curve starts to decrease before lobby's constraint is satisfied, whether there's a solution or not depends on whether $\pi(\tau^b(e_b)) - e_b$ decreases faster than $\pi(\tau^a)$
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
	
	
\vskip.5in
What do I need to show?
\begin{itemize}
	\item That, taking into account the dependency of $\tau^b$ on $e_b$, there exists a cutoff $\ov{e}$
	\item And, given this $\ov{e}$, the lobby's constraint binds
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It's really the same procedure as before: use Expression~\ref{ine:leg2} to define pairs of trade agreement tariffs and cutoff expenditure levels; then choose the pair with the lowest $\tau^a$ that satisfies Expression~\ref{ine:lob2}
		\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
