Literature on Asymmetric Punishments
\end{center}


New section on asymmetric punishments (addresses, in part, Giovanni's $\#$7)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Constrain to $T$-period class, now asymmetric---punish deviator more
	\item There is literature on this
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Bown 2002/2004
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Shocks, no enforcement
					\item Distinction is between legal and illegal
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Legal: TOT terms cancel, local effect only
							\item Illegal: TOT effect + local effect
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Beshkar 2010 EER (a)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item truthful revelation, no transfers, one shot
					\item asymmetry in size of punishment: compensation award through tariffs doesn't have to be as big as initial harm in order to induce truthful revelation
				\end{itemize}
			\item Beshkar 2010 JIE (b)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item GATT's instantaneous reciprocity rule (p. 39): immediate suspension of concessions under GATT escape clause
					\item 4 years with no retaliation under WTO Agreement on Safeguards
					\item No asymmetry as far as I can see on quick skim
				\end{itemize}
			\item Martin and Vergote
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Private info (random shock to import-competing sectors), no transfers, repeated game
					\item Retaliation is the cost for overstating one's own value of $\ga$--it's what delivers incentive compatibility
					\item Distinction is between reciprocity and retaliation
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Reciprocity: higher contemporary tariff (they have pre-play communication in a mechanism design framework)
							\item Retaliation: higher tariffs in the future
						\end{itemize}
					\item In contrast to Riezman 1991 (who has symmetric equilibria \`{a} la Green and Porter and then necessarily lower welfare), they have the same welfare level in punishment, just redistributed across players
						\begin{itemize}
							\item My note: this has flavor of the two different types of renegotiation issues: move inside the frontier or along it
						\end{itemize}
					\item They have an optimal level of asymmetry
					\item They show that asymmetry is necessary to deliver the efficient outcome (FLM Folk Theorem)
				\end{itemize}
			\item Hungerford 1991
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Asymmetric shocks, TOT is signal, NTBs
					\item Retaliation by going to optimal tariff level
					\item Retaliatory period: one country retaliates for past defection, defecting country plays BR (defect before other country can react)
					\item GATT (p. 364)
						\begin{itemize}
							\item Add cost of retaliation, but fast so retaliation starts in period $t+1$ for trigger in period $t$
							\item Investigation is domestic (hence cost), but must ``detect'' NTB in order to punish
							\item Countries don't spend enough on investigation to discourage NTBs entirely because they can't always detect them
						\end{itemize}
				\end{itemize}
			\item Riezman 1991
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Symmetric punishments
				\end{itemize}
			\item Bagwell (2008): commensurate vs. disproportionate retaliation
				\begin{itemize}
					\item disproportionate retaliation can compensate trading partner, who otherwise loses trade volume
					\item here, degree of disproportion increases in size of original violation: has to compensate for larger trade volume loss (p.15 of pdf)
				\end{itemize}
			\item Bagwell 2009: shocks are persistent
			\item Furusawa 1999: larger $\delta$ not always beneficial (fn 46, p. 42 of BBS lit review)
			\item Ludema 2001?
		\end{itemize}
